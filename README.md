# News Explorer App

## Overview

The **News Explorer App** is a simple, user-friendly application built with **React** that allows users to search for news articles and save their favorite ones for later reading. This app fetches news articles using **RESTful APIs** from various sources and presents them in an organized manner. Users can search for articles based on keywords and save the ones they find interesting for easy access at any time.

This README provides a guide for setting up, running, and contributing to the app within Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

## Features

- **Search News**: Allows users to search for articles using keywords.
- **Save Articles**: Users can save articles to their favorites list for future reference.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed with a clean and intuitive interface to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **RESTful API Integration**: The app fetches articles using RESTful APIs, providing flexibility in retrieving news from various sources.
- **Data Sync**: Saved articles are stored locally, allowing users to view them anytime.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- **VSCode**: Recommended IDE for development.
- **NPM or Yarn**: For package management.
- **React**: Front-end framework used to build the app.
- **RESTful API**: Used to retrieve news articles from external news sources.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the News Explorer App on your local machine using Visual Studio Code:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-explorer-app.git
cd news-explorer-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies:

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up API Keys

To fetch news articles, you need to register and get an API key from a news API provider like [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). Once you have the key, create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following:

```
REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 4. Run the Application

Now, you can run the application locally with:

Using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the app.

### 5. Explore the App

You can now:

- **Search** for news articles by entering keywords in the search bar.
- **Save** articles to your favorites by clicking the "Save" button next to the article.
- **View Saved Articles**: A separate section in the app displays all saved articles for easy access.

## Development Workflow

### Visual Studio Code Extensions (Optional)

Here are some recommended extensions for an optimal development experience in VSCode:

- **ESLint**: Linting JavaScript code.
- **Prettier**: Code formatting for consistent style.
- **Live Server**: Run the app in a local server for live reloading.
- **GitLens**: Visualize Git history and manage repositories.

### Code Style & Best Practices

This project follows standard JavaScript and React best practices. Here are some guidelines to follow when contributing:

- **Modular Code**: Each component should be focused on a single responsibility.
- **State Management**: Use React state or Context API for state management.
- **Styling**: Use CSS or styled-components for styling the application.
- **RESTful API**: The app uses RESTful APIs to fetch data, so ensure that API requests are efficient and well-structured.

### Running Tests

If there are any unit tests set up (e.g., using Jest), you can run them with:

```bash
npm test
```

Or:

```bash
yarn test
```
